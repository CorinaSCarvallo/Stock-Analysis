# Stock-Analysis
# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of the project is to do a refractor VBA code to efficiently collect the data to determing which stocks are worth investing in by analizing 2017 and 2018 data.
# Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Stocks performed better in 2017 then 2018. Only ENPH and RUN continued to do well in 2018. Run time for original script took longer then when running refractored script. The time between running 2017 and 2018 was not too different (see imagesabove).
# Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
# What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Advantage is that it improved the code and makes it cleaner. Disadvantage is that it can be time consuming and takes time to fix errors.
# How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
It took a lot of time to do the refractor and it took trial and error to make correction to coding errors. After refractoring the script, everytime it's run it runs faster each time.
